# rodeo
Rodeo is a data centric IDE for Python. You can think of it as an alternative UI to the notebook for the IPython Kernel.

## Quickstart
```bash
$ pip install rodeo 
$ rodeo .
```

## TODO
- [x] fix up terminal
- [x] change name
- [x] fix errors in kernel
- [ ] problems with kernel needing to execute things twice (?)
- [x] switch to python so it can be pip installable since users are 
python users (?)
- [ ] make boxes resizable (?)
